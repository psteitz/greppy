# 
# Search all files in ./test_files for lines where it is not the case that either ProductId
# is in the list 1123, 1128, 1129 OR ProductDescriotion contains the string "crumpets" (or both).
# So should return all records that don't contain "crumpets" in description and are not 1123, 1128, 1129.
# ./test_files is a directory, so the output includes the names of the files searched followed by the matched lines.
#
# Note that the same results would be returned if we moved NOT to the clauses and changed OR to AND:
# AND
# NOT | ProductId | [1121, 1128, 1129]
# NOT | ProductDescription | /crumpets/
#
./test_files
NOT
OR
ProductId | [1123, 1128, 1129]
ProductDescription | /crumpets/
