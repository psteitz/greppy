# 
# Search test.csv for lines where ProductDesription contains "nut" but ProductCategory is not 'snacks'.
#
# There can be as many match criteria after the AND as you like.  So, for example, adding another line like
# "ProductCategory | hoity toity"
# will restrict the output to lines with "hoity toity" in the ProductCategory column.
#
# The slashes around "nut" mean anything with a ProductDescription that includes the string "nut" will match that condition.
# The NOT at the beginning of the last line negates that condition.  Note the "|" following it to separate it from the field name.
