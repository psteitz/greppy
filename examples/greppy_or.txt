# 
# Search test.csv for lines where ProductId is in the list 1123, 2234, 1111 OR ProductDescriotion contains the string "crumpets" (or both).
#
# Note that if either ProductID or ProductDescriotion is not a field name (on first line of test.csv), this will return no lines.
#
# There can be as many match criteria after the OR as you like.  So, for example, adding another line like
# "ProductCategory | hoity toity"
# would also include all lines from the "hoity toity" category.
#
# The slashes around "crumpets" mean anything with a ProductDescription that includes the string "crumpets" will match.
